# Internet-Traffic-Classification
Classifying internet traffic using CNN

1) Our task is to classify different network services that are currently used by a communication flow. (HTTP, UDP, SMTPâ€¦).

2) Understand how different architectures of CNN and RNN can be used for network traffic classification.

3) Find out the performance of different types of deep neural network (CNN and RNN) for the problem of classifying network traffic.

4) Find out methods for reducing dimensionality of the dataset.
